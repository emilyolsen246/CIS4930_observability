Jaeger UI is a tool that shows the telemetry data of a remote source, like my local node repository. The telemetry data I received provides a record of the request made to the "todo-service" web service, including information about the duration of the request and the various parameters and tags associated with it. The trace shows a single GET request made to the "/todo" route of the service. It also includes other tags that provide additional information about the request, like the HTTP method used (GET), the HTTP status code returned (200 OK), and the user agent of the client that made the request (Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/16.2 Safari/605.1.15). The HTTP method “GET” is used to retrieve a representation of a resource from /todo. The HTTP status code describes the status of a server's response to a client's request. A status code of 200 means that the service successfully processed the GET request for the "/todo" resource and returned the requested data.
